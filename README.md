# About Daily-finance-automation-with-RestAssured:

In this project, a Postman collection was created by inspecting API requests from the website dailyfinance.roadtocareer.net. The collection includes APIs for various features, such as:

* Registering a new user
. Admin login
. Retrieving a user list
. Searching for a new user by user ID
. Editing user information
. User login (any user)
. Retrieving an item list
. Adding items
. Editing item names
. Deleting items from the list
. Implementing several negative test cases

The API collection was then automated using RestAssured, with TestNG as the testing framework, and an Allure Report was generated to present the test results.

# Technology used:

. Java (jdk 17).
. Postman. (Used for initial API exploration and request & response validation.)
. Intellij IDEA.
. Gradle. (Used to managed the dependencies.)
. Rest Assured. (Tool for automating REST API testing.)
. TestNG. (Used to implement tests.)
. Allure-Reporting. (Used to generate interactive and visually rich test execution reports.)

# HOW TO RUN?

. Clone or download this project.
. Open in Intellij IDEA
. Open terminal and provide the necessary commands to run the project and finally generate allure report.
